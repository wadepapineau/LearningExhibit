<h1>General Failures and Successes: A Brief Overview</h1>
<p>Overall, this course has been a steep and valuable learning experience for me. The tools and skills I have learned while working through the course material have opened my eyes to new ways in which to conduct and<br> 
present historical research. While there were certain elements of the coursewrok that just did not work for me, most of what did struck me as being very practical, not just in the context of digital history, but<br> 
also as a means for adding depth to topics of my own research interests.</p><br>
<h2>General Failures</h2>
<p>There were some general elements of the course that I just could not get working for me. The first of which was maintaining a blog. In this, surprisingly, I failed miserably. The reasonf for this is simple: I had<br> 
become so focused on completing exercises to prepare for my project that maintaining a blog became less and less of a priority, until finally it was something that fell through the cracks completely. In my defence, <br>
what did work for me as an alternative to blogging as a means of keeping a narrative of my experience of working through the course material was using ResophNotes and an <a href="https://github.com/wadepapineau/my-research-notebook" target="_blan">open notebook</a> GitHub repo.</p>
<p>Another thing I had difficulty with was using programs like Omeka to create galleries and webpages. While I undertand that these are meant to be an efficient and user-friendly means of creating galleries and<br> 
webpages, I found them to be difficult and time consuming to figure out. The UI in Omeka, for example, I found to be terribly counter-intuitive and confusing. After hours of trying to figure this out, I opted to<br> 
present all of my coursework by manualy doing the html programming myself (which itself was a chellenging and time consuming learning experience, but in the end is where I made more progress and was generally<br> 
more intuitive for me than anything else).</p>
<p>I also had difficulty using Recclaim Hosting in general. I had originally planned to host my html pages there, but after hours of fumbling with c-panel I had to admit defeat for the sake of committing my time to<br> 
to exercises and my final project. The worst part about all of this is, in hindsight, I could have just asked for help from the instructor and classmates. In the end it was my own stubornness and insistence on figuring things<br> 
out on my own that led to these shortcomings.</p>
<h2>General Successes</h2>
<p>Aside from all of that, overall, I feel that working through this course was a great success for me. That is, I really feel as though I have learned a lot from this experience. In other words, I am proud of what I have learned<br> 
and accomplished in the duration of this course. Learning basic html and css programming, using APIs to create datasets from online archives, learning to clean and fromat this data using a variety of tools, and finally how<br> 
to visualize and present that data are skills that I percieve to be invaluable as a student of history, and are skills that I intend to use in my studies outside of this course and for years to come. Essentially, this course has<br> 
forever changed the way in which I will approach historical research and presentation, having acquired new ways of gathering and alayzing historical research material.</p>
