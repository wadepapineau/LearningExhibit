<h1>Analyzing Data: Where Things Get Interesting</h1>
<p>I have to say, the exercises in this unit were a nice change of pace from the previous two. Finally getting to see the results from all of the back-end work done in the previous two modules was great. The tools covered on<br> 
this page were the ones I used in my project and I really enjoyed the exercises in this module.</p><br>
<h2>Text Analysis with Overview</h2>
<p>The first thing I noticed when working through this exercise was that Overview was a much better at topic modeling than the Topic Modeling Tool in the previous exercise. The UI was much moer intuitive and the whole<br> 
thing just felt easier to use overall. My original notes on this exercise can be found <a href="https://github.com/wadepapineau/my-research-notebook/blob/master/Module%204%253A%20Exercise%204%253A%20Text%20Analysis%20with%20Overview.txt" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>I played around with this a bit using the colonial dataset in order to see what ways in which this would be useful for my own project. I found that the Word Cloud graphic was very effective in quickly identifying<br> 
topics according to word frequency. I also thought that the different options you get here for Multisearch, Tree, etc. were very interesting.</p>

<h2>Visual Analysis Using RAW</h2>
<p>I found RAW to have some very interesting visualization tools and spent a lot of time messing about with this. My original notes on this can be found <a href="https://github.com/wadepapineau/my-research-notebook/blob/master/Module%204%253A%20Exercise%207%253A%20RAW.txt" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>There is not a whole lot to be said about this other than the obvious, which is that some of these charts work better than others according to what kind of data is being worked with. In the case of the Texas Correspondence<br>
dataset, I found the Circular Dendogram, Reignold-Tilford Tree, and the Treemap to work the best for identifying patterns in the data. In the case of my final project, I found the ALuvial diagram to work the best, where<br> 
none of the others really seemed appropriate.</p><br>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Overall I flet that this module was a nice change of pace from the last two. I think what surprised me the most was the fact that such tools are available as open source tools for anyone to use free of charge. With that<br> 
said, they are not without their problems. For example, my issue is that they are mostly lacking in costumization options. I also had problems using the Aluvial grah in my project, where I couldn't get the dates to be<br> 
displayed in order for example. But, they are open source, and that is great.</p>
