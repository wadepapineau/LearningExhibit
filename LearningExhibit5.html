<h1>Visualization and the Final Touches</h1>
<p>I enjoyed this module as well. Playing with graphics was interesting but I am no artist or graphic designer. To be honest, I was kind of stumped by the typography exercise. I understand the basics about serif and sans-serif<br> 
fonts but beyond that I felt kind of confused. In terms of determining what fonts work well together, I just didn't get it. The whole thing seemed rather subjective to me. I can see that there is a real art to this and I<br> 
get that this is the kind of thing that graphic designers take very seriously (my wife has a graphic design degree, she tried to explain it to me but I still didn't get it), but in the end the whole thing was lost on me.</p><br>
<h2>Inkscape and my Trouble with the Simple Things</h2>
<p>I thought this was a pretty neat program and I coudn't believe that it was open source (I know that graphic editors can be very expensive). Right away I noticed how much more complex it is than paintbrush, a bit of a<br> 
problem for someone like myself, but I see how with this comes a lot more editing options and possibilities. My initial notes on this exercise are <a href="https://github.com/wadepapineau/my-research-notebook/blob/master/Module%205%253A%20Exercise%201%253A%20Inkscape.txt" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>As I said above, the problem I had with this exercise was rather silly and the solution to it was right in front of my face the whole time. The problem was with step 10: adding a legend. I just could not figure out how to<br> 
add text to the graph. I could see easily enough how to add the font, but to add the text was beyond me for quite a while. After clicking around and just starring at it for a while, I suddenly saw what it was that I had to do.<br> 
The answer was so simple and obvious I started to wonder if there was something wrong with me. Perhaps almost 2 months of hardly sleeping was finally catching up to me (newborn baby at home). All I had to do was<br> 
click the "add text objects" button on the control panel on the left-hand side of the screen. It was starring me in the face the whole time. Ohter than that everything went well, but in the end, for the graphics within my<br> 
final project, I stuck with Paint for the sake of simplicity. This is what I ended up with, and the file can be found <a href="https://github.com/wadepapineau/my-research-notebook/blob/master/g3799.png" target="_blank">here</a>:</p>

<h2>Typography</h2>
<p>I had difficulty with this and, in the end, I do not think I ever really got it. Playign many round of Typeconnection made this very obvious to me. I didn't fail every time, but when I found a good match it was honestly<br> 
nothing but luck. I thin in total I had about three good matches out of at least ten tries. Not to mention, the fonts that I did match correctly were not available with Google Fonts. In the end, my font choices are the ones<br> 
you are seeing right now: Tinos sans-serif and Open-Sans-Condensed. They seem to me to work well together, but this of course is rather subjective and I could not really give a good reason why. The html file for the<br> 
exercise is <a href="http://wadepapineau.github.io/Module-5-Exercise-2-Typography/MyFontChoice.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><br>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I don't think I would be a good graphic designer. I enjoyed working through these exercises and have respect for design professionals. I think this is the kind of thing that you either have or do not. Like many artistic<br> 
disciplines, aptitdue is everything. So, what I learned here about design is this: its tougher than it looks, and it is not something to be taken for granted.</p>
